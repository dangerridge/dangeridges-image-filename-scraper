# Dangerridges Image Filename Scraper

The Image Filename Scraper is a web application that allows users to scrape image filenames from any URL and display them in a list. The application uses a regular expression to match all strings that end in .jpg, .png, or .gif, and returns them in a list.

##How to Use

To use the Image Filename Scraper, simply enter a URL in the input field and click the "Scrape Image Filenames" button. The application will scrape the page at the specified URL and display all image filenames that end in .jpg, .png, or .gif in a list.

##Technologies Used

The Image Filename Scraper is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also uses a CORS proxy server to bypass cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) restrictions.

##Development

To run the Image Filename Scraper locally, simply download the code and open the index.html file in a web browser. You can also modify the code to customize the application's functionality.

##License

The Image Filename Scraper is licensed under the MIT License. Feel free to use, modify, and distribute the code as you see fit.

## Project Info
This is a solo project written for work-related reasons, but incidentally it does meet the criteria to meet the "Page Scraper" project of Karan's Projects: https://github.com/karan/Projects#web
